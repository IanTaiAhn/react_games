# react_games

Tracking the same work I'm doing in another repo.

I will add updates here, since I want to show that I'm coding daily.
However I'm commiting to a different private repo.
Once the project is finished I'll clone the repo here.

Added more backend features, and almost have hangman completed.
After reading the React documentation several times, and browsing StackOverFlow for longer, I finally figured out how to use the "useState" in React to get my Hangman app working. It felt great! React is actually pretty neato.

We have done the thing! All of the code everyone has written is now compiled into one branch. Very cool.
Made my hangman app not as gross.

Hey we made some great progess with the login screen checking credentials! So now I have to pass in an array instead, and
go through all of databases usernames, and passwords to find if the user is a valid user. Nice!

Python is killer. Haha it's rough trying to get these modules organized. I will figure it out though.
