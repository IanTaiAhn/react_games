# react_games

Tracking the same work I'm doing in another repo.

I will add updates here, since I want to show that I'm coding daily.
However I'm commiting to a different private repo.
Once the project is finished I'll clone the repo here.

Added more backend features, and almost have hangman completed.
After reading the React documentation several times, and browsing StackOverFlow for longer, I finally figured out how to use the "useState" in React to get my Hangman app working. It felt great! React is actually pretty neato.

We have done the thing! All of the code everyone has written is now compiled into one branch. Very cool.
Made my hangman app not as gross.

Hey we made some great progess with the login screen checking credentials! So now I have to pass in an array instead, and
go through all of databases usernames, and passwords to find if the user is a valid user. Nice!

Python is killer. Haha it's rough trying to get these modules organized. I will figure it out though.
Hey good job on getting the front end nav bar figured out!

The project is coming along! used the localStorage to have data persistence, and really cleaned up the site.

Added a temp hangman table, since I don't like how I'm doing it atm.
Cleaned up the site a bit, and managed Dallin and my code combined.

Added a leaderboard, aka it replaced the server page I had to test all of the backend connections.
I styled the site a bit, and overall am getting ready to have a first final draft.

Styled the heck out of the website, however I'm willing to bet something broke because CSS is like that.

Fixed a bug.

I forgot to say that this is over, and done with now.
Good stuff myself. Pat yourself on the back man.

This is to track my progress on the Flutter project.
Adding class models to better organize our data.

crayz.

We have learned some stuff now. Read a whole lot, and we know how to recover data/restore it.
GOODSTUFF man!!
I finally got the delete functionality going. Very nice.

We now auto create a User with an Id that we can use to look up the user and access their information.
I think we are very close to having a legit app here....

Yah I'm straight killing it rn! Yee haw man its ttooooo eaassyy! Haha nah its not, but its mentally stimulating/fun.
Okay. So we can get contacts from an android phones as long as the permissions are set up correctly.
Next I'm going to create some good and efficient crud that allows us to create users based off of the contact we select.

I've gotten the structure figured out somewhat. It's honestly going quite well!
I'm proud of the progress I've made and Flutter is actually kind of dope.
I'm a good boi. heheeheh.

The text messages are working off of my phone now. My next step is to implement it so that a user may set up their daily/weekly/monthly texts in their account.
Made good progress on the Flutter app today.

I figured out the remaining data structuring!
Honestly, good job today. You did a good job!
